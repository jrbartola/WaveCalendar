## WaveCalendar

Ever wanted to find out what events are happening around you, but you just can't seem to find anything?
Wave Calendar solves that by allowing you to find local parties and events occuring near you.

This web application is built using MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack as well as a few jQuery plugins

## Requirements

**Node.js**

**Express.js**

**MongoDB and Mongoose**

Uses a database called "waves"

## Features

Once registered, users are able to:

* Dynamically search for waves (parties) within their town or up to 10 miles away from their current location
* Dynamically search for waves based on certain filters the wave has (i.e. "House" for house party, or "Paint" for a paint party)
* Use Google Maps' javascript API to find the location of a wave 
* Search for a wave by its randomly-generated registration code
* Attend a wave that is searched for
* Create a wave
* Make the wave invite-only; in this case it won't show up in the public results and the owner will have to personally give users the registration code and confirm their attendance
* Rate a wave and view it's average rating
* Create a username and a profile, where they can see other waves as well as their own waves
* Manage their account, delete waves, change their registered location, deactivate their account
